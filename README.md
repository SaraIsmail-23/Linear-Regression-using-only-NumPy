# Linear-Regression-using-only-NumPy
From Scratch
In this assignment, you’ll build a **Linear Regression model** step-by-step using only **NumPy** — 
Using a function called `train_test_split_np()` in order to Fit a line to training data using the **Normal Equation**
Finlly Make predictions on test data
Evaluate the model using MSE
